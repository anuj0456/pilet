# Pilet

Welcome to **Pilet**! ðŸš€

Pilet is an open-source agentic framework designed to help you create a local version of GPT-4o using any open-source model. With Pilet, you can leverage the power of state-of-the-art language models and customize them to suit your unique needs. Whether you're a researcher, developer, or enthusiast, Pilet provides the tools you need to build, fine-tune, and deploy powerful language models locally.

## Key Features

- **Agentic Framework**: Easily create and manage agents for various tasks.
- **Local GPT-4o**: Build a local version of GPT-4o using open-source models.
- **Customization**: Fine-tune models to meet your specific requirements.
- **Open-Source**: Free to use and modify, with a growing community of contributors.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch
- Transformers library from Hugging Face

### Installation

Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pilet.git
cd pilet
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

#### 1. Load Your Model

First, load your preferred open-source model. Pilet supports a variety of models from the Hugging Face model hub.

```python
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer

model_name = "your-model-name"
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(model_name)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
```

#### 2. Create an Agent

Create an agent using the Pilet framework. An agent is a modular component that can be used to perform specific tasks.

```python
from pilet import Agent

class MyAgent(Agent):
    def __init__(self, model, tokenizer):
        self.model = model
        self.tokenizer = tokenizer

    def respond(self, prompt):
        inputs = self.tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt")
        outputs = self.model(**inputs)
        return outputs

agent = MyAgent(model, tokenizer)
```

#### 3. Use the Agent

Interact with your agent to get responses based on your prompts.

```python
prompt = "What is the capital of France?"
response = agent.respond(prompt)
print(response)
```
